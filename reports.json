    "description": "Affordable energy is essential to help improve the quality of life for global citizens and to help economic growth. The global energy system is both large and complex. The last three years have seen dramatic changes in energy demand and supply caused initially by the COVID pandemic and then the Russian invasion of Ukraine. While this experience has shown the resilience of the global energy system, it has also again demonstrated the need to allow the energy markets to function as efficiently as possible to avoid disruption. This report discusses a number of key areas where industry and the administration can continue to work together to ensure the energy markets are as efficient as possible. These include ensuring continued free access to imports and exports of natural gas, crude oil, and refined products, removing barriers to supply such as permitting of production and processing, and enabling low-cost transportation for all types of energy. This report also discusses steps that should be taken to help respond to disruptions caused by hurricanes, cyber-attacks, and physical attacks.",

    "description": "The NPC members, through approving the 2014 NPC report Enhancing Emergency Preparedness for Natural Disasters, made a commitment to follow through with DOE and support implementation of the recommendations. In April 2016, DOE held the fourth annual 'Clear Path' energy sector preparedness exercise and changed the exercise from an academic session format of earlier Clear Path exercises and more toward a functional exercise. This exercise provided an opportunity to observe and document the implementation of the 2014 NPC report recommendations. The exercise planning, observation, and feedback built upon previous work completed by DOE and industry in working toward implementing the NPC report recommendations. The move to a functional exercise created the opportunity for industry and government to work together not just during the exercise, but during the planning and review processes. The 2016 NPC Implementation Addendum is a presentation and working paper that is the output of this effort, providing a detailed summary on progress in implementing the 2014 NPC report recommendations and opportunities for improvement.",

The recommendations identify mechanisms for the U.S. government and industry to improve communication and coordination in responding to energy system disruptions and fall into two broad categories: (1) leveraging institutional frameworks that are appropriately staffed and (2) maintaining readiness through sustaining mechanisms to address interdependencies, enhance capabilities, and continuously improve. The government and industry share a commitment to prepare for, mitigate the impacts from, and respond to the energy supply disruptions caused by natural disasters.",

The issue of most immediate interest and concern was the potential effect of a significant further disruption of petroleum exports from the Middle East. The Council's report recommended several actions to ensure that the impact of such a disruption on military needs and the U.S. economy, if it were to occur, would be minimized. The Council also cautioned against certain types of government response that could reduce the ability of the petroleum supply system to respond effectively.",

The report addresses global oil and gas supply to 2030, technologies for increasing supply and reducing demand, greenhouse gas emissions and CO2 management, and policy and regulatory issues to enable the most challenging energy issues facing the nation. Energy policy is a major issue in the United States, as evidenced by its high visibility in political campaigns and urgent policy discussions. But energy is a complex subject, touching every part of daily life and the overall economy, involving a wide variety of technologies, and deeply affecting many aspects of our foreign relations. The United States is the largest participant in the global energy system—the largest consumer, the second largest producer of coal and natural gas, and the largest importer and third largest producer of oil. Developing a framework for considering America's oil and natural gas position now and for the future requires a broad view and a long-term perspective; both are provided in this study, which was prepared in response to a request from the Secretary of Energy.",

The report provides insights on energy-market dynamics, including price volatility and future fuel choice, and an outlook on the longer-term sustainability of natural gas supplies. It also provides the Council's advice on actions that can be taken by industry and government to increase the productivity and efficiency of North American natural gas markets and to ensure adequate and reliable supplies of energy for consumers. The report analyzes natural gas demand, supply, and transmission in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The demand analysis provides an understanding of the economic and environmental determinants of natural gas consumption to estimate how the various sectors respond to different gas price regimes. The supply analysis develops a basin-by-basin supply curve for natural gas from various sources in the United States and Canada.",
